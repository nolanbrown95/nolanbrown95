### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello world! I'm Nolan, and along with my colleague @JulianGendreau, I have taken a special interest in using data science to help advance the field of medicine, with a particular liking for all things neuroscience and neurosurgery. Please browse my page as well as the page of my colleague Julian for helpful biomedical statistical methods. On the left you can find our website, med-dx.com, as well as a link to my peer-reviewed publications. Additionally, please check out our new book "The Future of Technology in Medicine: From Cyborgs to Curing Paralysis", which is available for preorder in advance of a June 2023 release date. Also, the price of our previously released book, "Alzheimer's Disease Decoded: The History, Present, and Future of Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia" has just been reduced on Amazon! Check it out to learn whether Alzheimer's might be a transmissible disease, how it relates to cancer, and the role our daily lives (and sleep cycles) play in this neurodegenerative pathology.
